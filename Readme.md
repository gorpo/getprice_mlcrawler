### How does it works? 
  When you execute the `main.py` file, it would ask you about 3 options: 
  - Search for product price: Will make a page requisition through the URL that you will input, return you product current price, product name and will ask you how much you can spend in this and ask if you want to save this values.
  - Check Promotions: Will make a requisition in every page you'd save and compare with price that you said beforely that you would pay.
  - Exit: Just say "Good Bye" and close program.
 

# Advantage:
  You don't need to open each page and check the price of each product you want.
